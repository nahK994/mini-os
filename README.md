# MiniOS

MiniOS is a **minimal, educational operating system** built to deeply understand  
how real systems work **under the hood** — from memory and execution to isolation and IO.

This project is **not** about replacing Linux.  
It is about **building engineering intuition** by stripping systems down to their core.
